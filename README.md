# DiamondLabWork
This is algorithmic program that create border of diamond 
using stars ( classical noob method <3 )which consist of just same odd number column and row ( for example 15 row and 15 column ) .
Why number should be the odd number I mean rows and columns because if the number equal to even number object cannot be a diamond,
it's just like the symmetric object. As well this program make some decisions such as  " Do you want to create another one " or something.
This is my university labwork  and I just want to share this program. Best regards DEVS ))
